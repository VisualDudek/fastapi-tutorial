| In FastAPI, how does it decide whether a function parameter is a **path** parameter or a **query** parameter?                  | If the parameter name appears in the path template (e.g., `/items/{item_id}`), it’s a path parameter; otherwise, it’s interpreted as a query parameter.       |
| Route is `/items/{item_id}` and handler params are `item_id: str, q: str \| None = None`. Where does `q` come from at runtime? | `q` is taken from the URL query string (the `?key=value` part); if it’s not provided, `q` is `None`.                                                          |
| What is the runtime structure of a URL query string (as FastAPI treats it)?                                                    | It’s a set of `key=value` pairs after `?`, separated by `&` (e.g., `?skip=0&limit=10`).                                                                       |
| Why does FastAPI need to convert query parameters before giving them to your function?                                         | Query values come from the URL and are “naturally” strings; type annotations tell FastAPI how to convert them and validate them before calling your function. |
| If a query parameter is annotated as `int`, what does FastAPI do with the incoming string value?                               | It parses the string into an `int` and validates it against that type before passing it to the function.                                                      |
| How do default values affect whether a query parameter is required?                                                            | If a non-path parameter has a default value, it’s not required; missing in the request means the function receives the default.                               |
| Handler has `skip: int = 0`. Client requests `/items/` without `skip`. What value does the function receive for `skip`?        | `skip` is `0` (the default), as if the client had sent `?skip=0`.                                                                                             |
| Handler has `skip: int = 0, limit: int = 10`. Client requests `/items/?skip=20`. What does the function receive for `limit`?   | `limit` stays `10` because only `skip` was overridden in the query string.                                                                                    |
| What does setting a query parameter’s default to `None` mean in FastAPI?                                                       | It makes the query parameter optional, and the function receives `None` when it’s not provided.                                                               |
| Handler has `q: str \| None = None`. Client omits `q`. What must your code be prepared to handle?                              | `q` will be `None`, so your code should handle the absence explicitly (e.g., conditional logic).                                                              |
| How does FastAPI parse `bool` query parameters (e.g., `short: bool = False`)?                                                  | It converts common truthy string values (e.g., `1`, `true`, `on`, `yes`, case-insensitive) to `True`; otherwise it yields `False` (or the default if absent). |
| Client calls `...?short=on` for `short: bool = False`. What boolean does the function see?                                     | `True`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Client calls `...?short=True` (or `short=true`) for `short: bool = False`. What boolean does the function see?                 | `True` (case variations are accepted).                                                                                                                        |
| When declaring multiple path and query parameters, does FastAPI require a specific parameter order in the function signature?  | No—FastAPI detects them by name; you can mix path and query parameters without a specific order.                                                              |
| What makes a query parameter *required* in FastAPI (without using extra helpers)?                                              | Don’t provide a default value; then it’s required and must be present in the query string.                                                                    |
| Handler has `needy: str` with no default. Client omits `needy`. What kind of response does FastAPI produce?                    | A validation error indicating the required query field is missing (e.g., location includes `["query","needy"]` and message like “Field required”).            |
| Handler has `limit: int \| None = None`. Client omits `limit`. What does the function receive?                                 | `None`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Handler has `limit: int \| None = None`. Client provides `limit` in the query string. What constraint does FastAPI enforce?    | If provided, the value must be parseable/valid as an `int`; optionality only affects whether it may be omitted.                                               |
