| In the “First Steps” tutorial, what is the `FastAPI` object (`app = FastAPI()`) in your program’s architecture?          | An instance of the `FastAPI` class that serves as the central object you attach routes to and expose as your application.                         |
| What is the key inheritance detail about `FastAPI` mentioned in “First Steps,” and why does it matter?                   | `FastAPI` inherits from Starlette, so Starlette features can be used through a FastAPI app instance.                                              |
| In “First Steps,” what does “path” mean in a *path operation*?                                                           | The URL portion starting at the first `/` after the domain (e.g., `/items/foo`), also commonly called an endpoint/route.                          |
| In “First Steps,” what does “operation” mean in a *path operation*?                                                      | An HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE); in OpenAPI terminology, each method is an “operation.”                                             |
| Why does the tutorial call HTTP methods “operations”?                                                                    | Because OpenAPI refers to each HTTP method on a given path as an “operation,” and FastAPI follows that terminology.                               |
| What does a *path operation* conceptually combine in FastAPI’s tutorial language?                                        | A URL path + an HTTP operation (method) + the Python function that handles requests for that combination.                                         |
| What does a *path operation decorator* do (e.g., `@app.get("/")`)?                                                       | It registers the function below it as the handler for requests to that specific path using that specific HTTP operation.                          |
| How do you define a handler for a non-GET HTTP method in FastAPI (per “First Steps”)?                                    | Use the matching decorator on `app`, e.g. `@app.post(...)`, `@app.put(...)`, `@app.delete(...)` (and others like `.patch()`, `.options()`, etc.). |
| According to “First Steps,” does FastAPI enforce REST-style meanings for HTTP methods (e.g., POST=create)?               | No—FastAPI doesn’t enforce any specific meaning; those method-to-action mappings are presented as guidelines, not requirements.                   |
| When is a *path operation function* called at runtime?                                                                   | Whenever FastAPI receives a request whose path and HTTP method match the decorator that registered that function.                                 |
| What two forms can a path operation function take in “First Steps”?                                                      | Either `async def` or a normal `def` function.                                                                                                    |
| In “First Steps,” what happens when a path operation function returns a Python `dict`?                                   | FastAPI automatically converts it into a JSON response body.                                                                                      |
| What kinds of return values are explicitly described as acceptable in “First Steps”?                                     | `dict`, `list`, and scalar values like `str`/`int`; also Pydantic models and many other objects that FastAPI can convert to JSON.                 |
| What is the purpose of the `/docs` endpoint created by FastAPI (in “First Steps”)?                                       | It serves automatic interactive API documentation using Swagger UI.                                                                               |
| What is the purpose of the `/redoc` endpoint created by FastAPI (in “First Steps”)?                                      | It serves alternative automatic API documentation using ReDoc.                                                                                    |
| What does FastAPI generate automatically for your API according to “First Steps”?                                        | An OpenAPI schema (“API schema”) describing your endpoints, parameters, and data models.                                                          |
| Where can you view the raw OpenAPI schema JSON for your running app (per “First Steps”)?                                 | At the `/openapi.json` endpoint.                                                                                                                  |
| In the tutorial, what does the term “schema” mean in general?                                                            | An abstract definition/description of something (not the code that implements it).                                                                |
| How are OpenAPI and JSON Schema related in the “First Steps” explanation?                                                | OpenAPI defines the API schema, and it uses JSON Schema to describe the shapes of JSON data sent/received by the API.                             |
| In “First Steps,” what are two practical uses of the OpenAPI schema besides documentation?                               | It powers the included doc UIs, and it can be used to generate client code (e.g., frontend/mobile/IoT clients).                                   |
| Which FastAPI CLI command does “First Steps” use to start the live development server for `main.py`?                     | `fastapi dev main.py`                                                                                                                             |
| In “First Steps,” what CLI command is suggested for production use instead of development mode?                          | `fastapi run`                                                                                                                                     |
| In the FastAPI CLI output shown in “First Steps,” what does an import string like `main:app` represent?                  | “Import `app` from the `main` module” (the object that the server will run).                                                                      |
| What are the two FastAPI Cloud CLI steps shown before your app is deployed (per “First Steps”)?                          | `fastapi login`, then `fastapi deploy`.                                                                                                           |
| What does “First Steps” emphasize about deploying FastAPI outside of FastAPI Cloud?                                      | FastAPI is open source and standards-based, so you can deploy it to any cloud provider you choose.                                                |
| Example — write the minimal FastAPI app from “First Steps” that serves `GET /` and returns `{"message": "Hello World"}`. | `python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}\n`       |
| Example — show the “First Steps” variant where the `GET /` handler is a normal (sync) function.                          | `python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello World\"}\n`             |
