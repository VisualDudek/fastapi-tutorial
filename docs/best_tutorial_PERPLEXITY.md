The single best starting point is the official FastAPI “Tutorial – User Guide”, then one full video course plus one longer written guide, depending on how deep you want to go.[1][2][3]

## If you want official, structured docs

- **FastAPI Tutorial – User Guide (official docs)**: Step‑by‑step, production‑oriented, covers almost everything (request/response models, dependencies, auth, testing, etc.), and has a matching “Advanced User Guide” once you finish the basics.[1]
- This is the best reference-quality tutorial and should be your backbone even if you learn via video.  

## If you want a modern video course

- **FastAPI Beyond CRUD – Full Course (YouTube, ~12h)**: Treat this as a serious course rather than a “crash”. It goes from basic routing through SQLModel, auth with JWT, role-based access control, middleware, background tasks with Celery, testing (pytest, Schemathesis), and deployment on Render.[3]
- For a shorter intro before that:  
  - **FastAPI Tutorial for Beginners – Full Course (ProgrammingKnowledge, 3h+)** gives you a complete beginner‑to‑working‑API path including Pydantic models, DB integration, and deployment basics.[4]

## If you prefer written, article-style learning

- **Real Python – Get Started With FastAPI**: Opinionated, high‑quality code examples and explanations; very good if you like the Real Python style and want a project‑like walkthrough.[2]
- **PyImageSearch – Getting Started with Python and FastAPI**: Focuses on building and testing endpoints, Pydantic validation, and common error fixes; nice as a companion when you start writing your own API, especially if you later expose ML models.[5]

## Recommended path for you

Given your background and comfort with Python and async:  

1. Skim the **official Tutorial – User Guide** end‑to‑end to internalize the idioms.[1]
2. Do the **ProgrammingKnowledge 3h FastAPI Beginner Course** to get a concrete project under your fingers.[4]
3. Then commit to the **“FastAPI Beyond CRUD”** series to cover DI, auth, background jobs, and testing in a way that’s close to real services.[3]

If you tell which stack you target (plain SQLAlchemy vs SQLModel, sync vs fully async, deployment on Render/AWS/etc.), a more opinionated “stack + tutorial combo” can be laid out.
